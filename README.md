## Machine Learning with Python Cookbook

This repository has Notebooks of notes and practice code while following the
Machine Learning with Python Cookbook - Practical Solutions from Preprocessing to Deep Learning
by [Chris Albon](https://chrisalbon.com/). This book is for the machine learning practitioner
who, while comfortable with the theory and concepts of machine learning,
would benefit from a quick reference containing code to solve challenges.
